# Neural Net Tic-Tac-Toe
This project uses a Neural Network guided Monte-Carlo Tree-Search to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

# Completed Tasks
1. Implement Monte-Carlo Tree Search Algorithm
2. Rework MCTS framwork to work with Neural Network.
3. Add Neural Network class
4. Elimate all errors and bugs with MCTS + NN framwork
5. Add policy.bin file to store NN policy
6. Implement NN training

#ToDo
1. Conduct large scale testing to determine if NN is indeed learning
